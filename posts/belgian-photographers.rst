At the end of the years, it's the time for gifts and especially photography books. As we have to focus in photography, I'll just
list some of my favorite Belgian photographers and some of their books. There are a lot of books published in photography but some
attracted more my eyes... I really enjoyed "Charleroi, il est clair que le gris est noir" by Stephan Vanfleteren. An incredible
vision of Charleroi, a city in the center of the coal basin and strongly hit by the melt down of the industries. Stephan did
an impressive work (with strong black) while touching the viewer with a forceful human perspective to this city. Another interesting book
is the work of Manuel Lauti with Pages Inattendues. A vigorous relationship with people, reading and connecting them with a small extract.
