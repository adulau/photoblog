Self portrait is a difficult exercise for me. It might seems to be a kind of
paradox because I'm taking pictures of the others. And the paradox becomes
bigger at a time where people use their portable cameras (read phone) to make
their self portraits.

I found a single self-portrait_ in my archive. When I took this one,
it was a matter of typography of the "a" letter. Nothing more.

For a majority of people, taking a picture of themself is easy and this seems
a natural process. I enjoy people using camera to shoot themself as they appear
to forget about their surrounding for a short period. It's a little instant where
they forget about the world. Taking this instant, it's kind of magic. Like the
selfie with the lady and the goat_.
