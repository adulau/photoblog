In term of photography, I'm still a big naive photographer. I had this impression that photography still
embraces freedom, the acceptance of unconventional artistic perspective and openness in terms of diversity.
There are many photo groups on Internet and I decided to upload a photography to a group called street photography.

Then something happened, the picture was rejected. Reading the rules, it seems that the definition of street photography
is more than strict than expected. Then I decided to wander around various photography groups which are classified as *street photography*.
