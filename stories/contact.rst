It's not an impressum. It's not really a colophon. It's not even a site notice or an ugly legal disclosure. This is just my contact information.

I do photography just because I love and enjoy it. If you want to work on a photographic project with me, let me know.

You can reach me at the following address: Alexandre Dulaunoy 10, rue du faubourg B6811 Les Bulles - Chiny Belgium (Europe)

My email address is: a (@) foo (.)be
